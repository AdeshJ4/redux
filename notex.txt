store:

A store holds the whole state tree of your application. The only way to change the 
state inside it is to dispatch an action on it.

A store is not a class. It's just an object with a few methods on it. To create it, 
pass your root reducing function to "createStore".

Store Methods

getState()
dispatch(action)
subscribe(listener)
